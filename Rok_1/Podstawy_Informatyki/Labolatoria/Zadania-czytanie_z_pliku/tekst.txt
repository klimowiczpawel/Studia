Greatness

I  will be great, the acorn said,
But  everyone laughed,
You' re quite off your head!

I will be great, the little shoot knew,
But everyone jeered,
What,, a pipsqueak like you!

I will be great, said the sapling green,
But everyone scoffed,
You can barely be seen!!!!

I will be great, said the fine young tree,
And everyone mumbled,
We'll see,,,, we',,, ll see......

Now I am great, said the oak stout and tall,
And the trees all agreed,
You're the king of us all!
Paul King
